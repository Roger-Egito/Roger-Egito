Hello! Welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Brazilian undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Information Systems. I also teach English as Second Language and I'm trying to grow my own online business. 

I like to work with Software and Game Development and my hobbies include playing Video Games and TTRPGs. I have participated in several projects both front and back-end, such as a project of the Systematization of Wounds for Nursing Care with the objective of managing the nursing care provided to patients with chronic wounds treated at the points of Primary and Secondary Health Care based on the Nursing Process in partnership with the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).

I have participated in the creation of Mobile Apps, Web Pages, and Desktop Apps during my internship, and my personal projects include the creation of Gaming Software, a TTRPG System, YouTube Channels, and Websites, as well as Social Media Management in order to practice SEO, marketing strategies and how to grow a brand from nothing.

I'm always looking for new opportunities and really enjoy learning!
