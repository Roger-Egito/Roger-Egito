Hi! Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roger Egito!

I'm a Brazilian undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Information Systems. (Think of it as Computer Science + Administration)

I like to work with Software and Game Development and my hobbies include playing Video Games and TTRPGs. Currently practicing Flutter and JavaScript, I have participated in several projects both front and back-end, among them, a project of Systematization of Wounds for Nursing Care with the objective of managing the nursing care provided to patients with chronic wounds treated at the points of Primary and Secondary Health Care based on the Nursing Process in partnership with the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).

I'm always looking for new opportunities and really enjoy learning!
