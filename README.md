Hi there! ðŸ‘‹


My name is Roger Egito!

I'm a Brazilian undergraduate studying computer programming currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Systems. 


I enjoy working on projects that create a better tomorrow and my hobbies include playing video games, so you can expect those kinds of projects from me here.
Currently learning Python, React, TypeScript, Heroku, and Postgre SQL by working on different projects. Among them, a project for the Systematization of Nursing Care in Wounds with the objective of managing the nursing care provided to patients with chronic wounds treated at Primary and Secondary Health Care points based on the Nursing Process in partnership with Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.


Are you looking for a programmer? I'm pursuing opportunities to help with my studies and would like to help you by delivering a well made system with the best of my abilities and passion. I'm willing to learn and would appreciate the experience, so feel free to contact me!
